To assist you in making informed choices, the Israeli Product Checker offers a user-friendly solution. This tool guides you in determining whether a product is affiliated with Israel or if it is manufactured in Israel. Simply follow these steps:

1. Click on the provided link to access the `Israeli Product Checker tool <https://www.emzeth.com/en/israel-product-checker/>`_.
2. In the search box, enter the brand name of the product you are considering purchasing.
3. If the product is associated with Israel or any of its supporters, a message will be displayed, stating that the brand is either affiliated with or supports Israel’s actions in Palestine through material or moral contributions to the occupation.
4. If the product is not of Israeli origin or connected to its supporters in any way, the tool will display a message indicating that there is no official information or facts to suggest any affiliation with Zionist-linked companies or support for the Jewish occupation of Palestine.

It’s important to consider the economic impact of boycotting Israeli products. Boycotts can lead to reduced sales, resulting in decreased corporate revenues and profits. For example:

- SodaStream, an Israeli company manufacturing home soda-making machines, saw its stock price drop by as much as 20% following calls to boycott Israeli products amid the Israel-Palestine conflict in 2014.
- Electra Consumer Products, an Israeli company producing household appliances such as washing machines, refrigerators, and televisions, saw its stock price decline by up to 15% in 2015 after calls to boycott Israeli products.
- Strauss Group, an Israeli company specializing in food and beverages, including dairy products, juices, and ice cream, experienced a 10% fall in its stock price in 2016 due to calls for boycotts.

While boycotts can raise awareness of `israel product <https://www.emzeth.com/en/>`_, it’s crucial to note that they can have adverse effects on Israeli companies. As a result, it’s essential for Israeli companies to develop strategies to address boycotts, such as conducting educational campaigns about their products or diversifying their markets.

- Look for "Made in Israel" or "Product of Israel" labels on the product description or packaging.
- Search the brand or product online to see if information about its origin is available.
- Contact the seller directly to inquire about the product's country of origin.

The Israeli Product Checker offers consumers a valuable tool to make informed choices about the products they purchase. By understanding the potential economic impact of boycotting Israeli products and utilizing alternative methods for checking product origin, consumers can align their purchasing decisions with their values and contribute to broader social and economic change.
